# QuantumGoFish
Quantum go fish is a card game generally played without cards. There is a detailed discussion of the game at https://stacky.net/wiki/index.php?title=Quantum_Go_Fish.

## Extra Rules
I had to add some extra rules to make it possible to play the game.

* If a position repeats itself (i.e. the same cards and the same player to move), the game is declared a draw. Otherwise it is possible for a game to go on for ever, with players just swapping the same cards.
* If a player has no cards at all, they skip their go. (Clearly, if all the players but one have no cards, then the game has already ended.)
